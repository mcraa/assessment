# JavaScript/Front-end Developer - Exercise 1

## Instructions

- Fork this project.
- Write tests.
- Don't use external libraries for the conversion.
- Commit the important milestones and not just the final result.

## Exercise description

Create an application that contains a web form, which has a numeric input field and a submit button.

When the user gives an arabic number, the system shows the english phrase of that number.

For example:
<pre>
7    == seven
42   == forty-two
2001 == two thousand and one
1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
17999 == seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
</pre>

That's all.


- add an url for the number convertion documentation, or at least metion the rules that we expect.
- have a check list of what should be checked in each assessment
    - describe what the reviewees should write on the card about their evaluation
        - their opinion: go - not go
        - their reasons: pros and cons about the solution
- don't use frameworks in the first one
- don't specify that a form is needed
- don't constrain the solution to only one language
    - maybe talk on the email about it
- state about a problem to be solved (eg.: allow an user to input a number and get the "translated string back")
- simplify the assessments structure
    - have just the first and second
    - do not separate 

- assessments to keep:
    - first:
        - numerals
    - second:
        - backend (todo)
        - frontend (users)
        - mobile (github)
